## Challenge Background

It's time to put away the Excel sheet and enter the world of programming with Python.
In this assignment, you'll use the concepts you've learned to complete two Python challenges,
PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where your newly developed Python
scripting skills come in handy.

## Files

### PyBank

    ```main.py```
    * This is the main python file which runs the code for the PyBank portion of this challenge

    ```/Resources/budget_data.csv```
    * This file is the csv file which is analysed by main.py

    ```/Analysis/data_analysis.txt/```
    * This is the output file from main.py

### PyPoll

    ```main.py```
    * This is the main python file which runs the code for the PyPoll portion of this challenge

    ```/Resources/election_data.csv```
    * This file is the csv file which is analysed by main.py

    ```/Resources/election_data.xlsx```
    * This is a file created to include a pivot table with the total values of the data
    * This was used to check the functionality of main.py and is not used in the main program

    ```/Analysis/data_analysis.txt/```
    * This is the output file from main.py
